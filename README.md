## About
Project Radio Telescope is a initiative wherein we are building a 5 Metre Radio Telescope at BITS Pilani, K. K. Birla Goa Campus.
The objective of this project is to design and build a 5-m Radio Telescope, along with its adjoining automated mount, electronic circuitry, control systems, and software packages for operation and analysis.

We will track the sun and detect Hydrogen Clouds in the galaxy and analyse the data to get Galactic Rotation Curves. We will observe the 21cm H lines coming from various parts of the sky and also observe the sun and obtain solar surface temperature and  other properties. With a longtime integration of received data, we can detect fainter radio sources like pulsars.

We are a group of students immensely interested in radio astronomy hence we came up with this idea of establishing our own setup. This ensures that we do not have to wait for our turn to use some other facility.
